# A repository of data analysis that I have done in my spare time. 


**Movie Data**

This is data from a public dataset about Hollywood films from 2012 - 2016. I have done the following:

- Cleaned, sorted the data from the Movie Data sheet(checked for nulls, incorrect formats, outliers, filtering and putting data into order for easier reading)
- Created a pivot table Summary to check which genre had the highest profit as well as their budget.
- Created a pivot table Revenue to check which year was the most successful in terms of profit.

**SA Population 2020**

This data is publicly available from Statistics South Africa, and it contains an estimated population by age in the year 2020. It is cleaned, sorted using Excel and SQL Server. What I have done is:

- Checked the data for any nulls, errors, incorrect information
- Formatted numbers, names and column names for easier reading
- created a duplicate and removed unnecessary data
- filtered the information by province, district and municipality (the structure of local government in South Africa). I created an additional sheet with information from my province, Eastern Cape.
- Added an easy to read map on the Province sheet detailing the population of each province. 


**Tableau Visualisations**

CO2 Emissions, Happiness Index and World Happiness Index are visualisations which I have created using data from a public dataset on Kaggle. [My tableau profile can be seen here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/wesley.schroeder)

**Cyclistic Bike Share project**

An analysis of casual and member rider patterns throughout the year in order to find out how to improve membership rates. [Raw data](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html) from a public dataset was downloaded, cleaned and sorted with Excel. Additional columns were created for ride length, day of the week. Using this information, I was able to determine the average ride length for each month/year according to casual/member riders as well as identify which periods (days, months and seasons) had the highest/lowest share of rides. This was done using SQL Server, and Excel.
