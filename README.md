Movie Data

This is data from a public dataset about Hollywood films from 2012 - 2016. I have done the following:

- Cleaned, sorted the data from the Movie Data sheet(checked for nulls, incorrect formats, outliers, filtering and putting data into order for easier reading)
- Created a pivot table Summary to check which genre had the highest profit as well as their budget.
- Created a pivot table Revenue to check which year was the most successful in terms of profit.
