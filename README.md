# A repository of data analysis that I have done in my spare time. 


**Movie Data**

This is data from a public dataset about Hollywood films from 2012 - 2016. I have done the following:

- Cleaned, sorted the data from the Movie Data sheet(checked for nulls, incorrect formats, outliers, filtering and putting data into order for easier reading)
- Created a pivot table Summary to check which genre had the highest profit as well as their budget.
- Created a pivot table Revenue to check which year was the most successful in terms of profit.

**SA Population 2020**

This data is publicly available from Statistics South Africa, and it contains an estimated population by age in the year 2020. It is cleaned, sorted and ready for analysis. What I have done is:

- Checked the data for any nulls, errors, incorrect information
- Formatted numbers, names and column names for easier reading
- created a duplicate and removed unnecessary data
- filtered the information by province, district and municipality (the structure of local government in South Africa). I created an additional sheet with information from my province, Eastern Cape.
- Added an easy to read map on the Province sheet
